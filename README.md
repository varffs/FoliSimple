FoliSimple Theme for GetSimple CMS

----------------------------------

### ABOUT

A simple and clean portfolio type theme with a fixed top menu bar. Perfect for easy presentation of projects, and suitable for long text blocks as well as wide images.

Uses a simple and clear jquery toggle menu for both a list of project pages and a bio text.

The HTML/CSS is simple and commented where relevant allowing customisation with only basic HTML/CSS knowledge.


### INSTALLATION

Upload the folisimple folder to your getsimple theme folder.

Activate the theme

Add a component called 'about'. The component content will fill the content of the About Me toggle box.

Edit your Home page options to exclude it from the projects drop down list. [Uncheck the 'Add this page to the menu' checkbox]

Thats it!


### additional actions

If you want a title to the Home page [like the page title at the top of all other pages] then rename the Home page to anything else.

If you want to change colors, typographer or more go to the style.css file found in this theme's folder. This file is set up for simple editing of colors and type, but it is commented for further customisation.
